3. Set the Trapper password:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe config set GENERAL.password your_password
```

4. Test the connection to Trapper:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe helpers test-connection
```

You should see a confirmation if the connection is successful.

## 4. Configure your working directories

To use **wildintel-tools** efficiently, you need to create a main directory, for example, in your **Documents** folder 
called **wildintel-data**. Inside this main directory, create the following subdirectories:

 * `collections/` – Store all your raw camera trap data here. Organize collections (e.g., recording sessions or revisions) as subfolders.
 * `collections-ready-to-trapper/`: this folder contains collection restructured into the format expected by trapper-tools. The contents of this directory are automatically generated by the wildintel-tools application after the validation and enrichment process.

After creating the directories, you need to configure **wildintel-tools** to point to them. Execute the following 
command to set the collection directory:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe config set GENERAL.data_dir $HOME\Documents\wildintel-data\collections
```

and to set the ready to trapper directory:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe config set WILDINTEL.output_dir $HOME\Documents\wildintel-data\collections-ready-to-trapper\
```

Finally, check that changes have been applied:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe config show
```

## 5. Organize collections

To prepare your camera trap data for processing, you need to organize your collections (revisions) in the `collections/` 
directory you created earlier. Each collection should be placed in its own subfolder within the `collections/` directory. 
For example, if you have two collections named `R0033` and `R0001`, your directory structure should look like this:

![Organize collections](faq_install_windows_uv_16.png)

> ⚠️ Important note
> **Collection names** must start with the letter R followed by four digits. Examples: `R0001`, `R0234`, `R1025`.

Each collection folder should contain one or more subfolders for different camera trap deployments or locations. For example:
if you have a collection named `R0033` with two deployments, `r0033-wicp_0001` and `r0033-wicp_0001`, the structure 
should be as follows:

![Deployments](faq_install_windows_uv_17.png)

> ⚠️ Important note
> **Deployment names** must be the concatenation of the collection name and the location identifier, separated by a hyphen (-).

The second part of the deployment name (after the hyphen) is the location identifier, you can check the names of the
 locations create in Trapper executing the command:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe helpers locations
```

Inside each deployment folder, place all the raw images and videos captured by the camera trap during that deployment:

Finally, each collection folder must contain a csv file that includes metadata about the recording deployments. That is, 
for each deployment this file incluyes information about when deployment started and ended. The name of this file must be 
the collection name followed by `_FileTimestampLog.csv`.

![Filetimestamp](faq_install_windows_uv_17.png)

Following our example, as collection `R0033` has two deployments, the metadata file should contain two entries.

## 6. Validating collections

Before uploading your collections to Trapper, it is recommended to validate that collections and their deployments have
been organized correctly. You can check the structure of your collections:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe wildintel check-collection 
```

![Filetimestamp](faq_install_windows_uv_20.png)

You can check the structure of your deployments:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe wildintel check-deployments 
```

## 7. Preparing collections

Once your collections have been validated, you can proceed to prepare them for upload to Trapper. This process includes
enriching the metadata and restructuring the data into the format expected by Trapper. 

> ⚠️ Important note
> Enriching the metadata consists in attach XMP information into each image. You can customize this metadata changing
> the following configuration options: rp_name, coverage,  publisher, and owner.
> 

To prepare your collections, run the following command:

```
.\wildintel-tools.exe wildintel prepare-for-trapper 
```

![Filetimestamp](faq_install_windows_uv_22.png)

After the process is complete, the prepared collections will be available in the `collections-ready-to-trapper/` directory
you configured earlier.

After all these steps, you are now ready to use `trapper-tools` to upload your prepared collections to Trapper!

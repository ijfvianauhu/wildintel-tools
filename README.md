## Utilities for managing and validating WildIntel data

## üöÄ Features

- **Check collectionss**: Validates the names of collections and deployments within a given data directory. 
- **Check deployments**: Validates the structure and content of deployment folders within the specified collections. Checks that image files exist, follow the expected chronological order, and that their "
        timestamps are within the expected start and end ranges. Also generates a '.validated' file for successfully verified deployments.
- **Prepare deployments**: Prepara la estructura de directorios necesaria para importar colleciones usando la aplicaci√≥n Trapper tools. Las im√°genes son redimensionadas y se le a√±ade distinta informaci√≥n XMP.


## üìã Requirements

* Python 3.12 or higher  
* uv (for dependency management and packaging)  
* Typer and rich (for CLI interface)  
* dynaconf (for configuration management)
* pyexiftool (for metadata extraction)
* Docker (optional, for running in a container)
* Access to a Trapper server instance

## üß≠ Overview

WildIntel Tools is a utility suite for validating and preparing wildlife monitoring data. It ensures that collection and 
deployment folders follow standardized naming conventions, verifies that images exist and are in chronological order, and 
marks validated deployments with a .validated file.

Once validated, it prepares collections for import into Trapper, flattening folder structures, resizing images, and 
embedding essential XMP metadata.

In short, WildIntel Tools streamlines the workflow from data quality control to ready-to-use datasets, keeping information 
consistent, traceable, and properly formatted for analysis.

To use trapper-tools effectively, store all your raw camera trap data in a main project directory. Organize collections (e.g., recording sessions) as subdirectories, and group files by deployments (e.g., individual camera locations) in further subfolders. Ensure these folder names match the deployment codes in your TRAPPER database, as this will be validated during the packaging step. The expected structure of multimedia files and subdirectories in the root (project) directory is as follows:

```
|- collection_name_1
|  |- deployment_id_1
|     |- filename_1
|     |- filename_2
|     |- filename_3
|     |- filename_4
|  |- deployment_id_2
|     |- filename_1
|     |- filename_2
|     |- filename_3
|     |- filename_4
|  |- ...
|- collection_name_2
|  |- deployment_id_3
|     |- ...
|  |- ...
|- ...
```

WildIntel Tools uses TOML configuration files to manage project settings. Each project can have its own configuration. 
See [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

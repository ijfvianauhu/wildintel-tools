## Utilities for managing and validating WildIntel data

## üöÄ Features

- **Check collectionss**: Validates the names of collections and deployments within a given data directory. 
- **Check deployments**: Validates the structure and content of deployment folders within the specified collections. Checks that image files exist, follow the expected chronological order, and that their "
        timestamps are within the expected start and end ranges. Also generates a '.validated' file for successfully verified deployments.
- **Prepare deployments**: Prepara la estructura de directorios necesaria para importar colleciones usando la aplicaci√≥n Trapper tools. Las im√°genes son redimensionadas y se le a√±ade distinta informaci√≥n XMP.


## üìã Requirements

* Python 3.12 or higher  
* uv (for dependency management and packaging)  
* Typer and rich (for CLI interface)  
* dynaconf (for configuration management)
* pyexiftool (for metadata extraction)
* Docker (optional, for running in a container)
* Access to a Trapper server instance

## üß≠ Overview

WildIntel Tools is a utility suite for validating and preparing wildlife monitoring data. It ensures that collection and 
deployment folders follow standardized naming conventions, verifies that images exist and are in chronological order, and 
marks validated deployments with a .validated file.

Once validated, it prepares collections for import into Trapper, flattening folder structures, resizing images, and 
embedding essential XMP metadata.

In short, WildIntel Tools streamlines the workflow from data quality control to ready-to-use datasets, keeping information 
consistent, traceable, and properly formatted for analysis.

To use trapper-tools effectively, store all your raw camera trap data in a main project directory. Organize collections (e.g., recording sessions) as subdirectories, and group files by deployments (e.g., individual camera locations) in further subfolders. Ensure these folder names match the deployment codes in your TRAPPER database, as this will be validated during the packaging step. The expected structure of multimedia files and subdirectories in the root (project) directory is as follows:

```
|- collection_name_1
|  |- deployment_id_1
|     |- filename_1
|     |- filename_2
|     |- filename_3
|     |- filename_4
|  |- deployment_id_2
|     |- filename_1
|     |- filename_2
|     |- filename_3
|     |- filename_4
|  |- ...
|- collection_name_2
|  |- deployment_id_3
|     |- ...
|  |- ...
|- ...
```

WildIntel Tools uses TOML configuration files to manage project settings. Each project can have its own configuration. 
See [Configuration](#configuration) section for details.

## üíª Installation

wildintel-tools requires several system utilities to be installed before it can be properly set up.
The following section explains how to install these required tools.

Subsequent sections describe the different methods available for installing wildintel-tools.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:**  
> If you choose to install wildintel-tools using Docker, you do not need to install these utilities manually.

### Install required tools

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
# Install ExifTool
sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
```

#### Windows 10/11

**Git Bash for Windows**, install using `winget`: 
```bash
# Download from https://gitforwindows.org/
# Or install using winget:
winget install -e --id Git.Git
```

**FFmpeg & ExifTool**, install using `winget`:
```bash
# Install ExifTool
winget install -e --id OliverBetz.ExifTool
```

Alternative manual installation:
- FFmpeg: Download from [ffmpeg.org/download.html](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)
- ExifTool: Download from [exiftool.org](https://exiftool.org)

After installation:
1. Add FFmpeg's bin directory to your system PATH (typically `C:\Program Files\ffmpeg\bin`)
2. Add ExifTool to your system PATH (typically `C:\Program Files\exiftool`)

### Install wildintel-tools using `uv`

```
# Install uv if not already installed
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
git clone https://github.com/ijfvianauhu/wildintel-tools.git
cd wildintel-tools
uv sync
```

### Install wildintel-tools using `docker`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Wildintel Tools uses [TOML](https://toml.io/en/) configuration files to manage project settings. Each project can have 
its own configuration, and every command performs strict validation, reporting missing or malformed keys with clear 
error messages. You can create multiple project configurations for different Trapper servers, projects, and settings, and 
switch between them using the `--project` flag.

```bash
wildintel-tools [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...  
```

### Options

Root-level configuration arguments:
- --version   :                         Show program's version number and exit                                             ‚îÇ
- --verbosity : Logger level: 0 (error), 1 (info), 2 (debug). 
- --logfile   : Path to the log file
- --locale    : Language code (for example, ‚Äúes‚Äù, ‚Äúen‚Äù). By default, the system language is used.
- --project   : Project name for settings [default: default]                                       ‚îÇ
- --env-file  : Load .env file with dotenv                                                         ‚îÇ
- --settings-dir : Directory containing settings files                                                ‚îÇ
- --install-completion                 Install completion for the current shell.                                          ‚îÇ
- --show-completion                    Show completion for the current shell, to copy it or customize the installation.   ‚îÇ
- --help                               Show this message and exit.       

### Command

-  config      Manage project configurations‚îÇ
-  wildintel   Utilities for managing and validating WildIntel data                                                        ‚îÇ

Configuration command arguments:
- `--init`: Create a new configuration file.
- `--list`: List available configurations.
- `--edit`: Open the configuration file in the default text editor (nano for Docker version).
- `--show`: Validate and display the current configuration.
- `--template`: Import settings from a custom TOML template file.


### Examples

```bash
# Create new default configuration at ~/.trapper-tools/default.toml
wildintel-tools config --init 

# Create new configuration with named project
wildintel-tools --project myproject config --init 

# Edit configuration file for a specific project
wildintel-tools --project myproject config --edit

# Export configuration to custom location using template
wildintel-tools config --template /path/to/template.toml --init

# Show configuration
wildintel-tools --project myproject config --show

# List available configurations
wildintel-tools config --list

# Use custom settings directory
trapper-tools --settings-dir /path/to/settings config --init
```

### Configuration File Structure

### Updating Configuration

Configuration edits are made directly in the TOML file. Use `trapper-tools config --edit` to open the file in the built-in
or your default editor, or provide a pre-built template with `--template`. All settings are validated before saving. Each 
time you run `config --show`, `convert`, `package`, `upload`, or `pipeline`, the configuration is validated and detailed errors 
are reported if any required variables are missing or have invalid values.


## ‚ö° Usage

Once you‚Äôve installed [Wildintel-tools](https://github.com/ijfvianauhu/wildintel-tools), you can start using it 
right away from the command line. Here‚Äôs what a typical first session looks like from a user‚Äôs perspective.


### Configure 

First of all, initialize the configuration file by running:

```python
wildintel-tools config init
```

Once this is done, edit it and modify the environment variables by running:
```python
wildintel-tools config edit
```
You can find a detailed description of each configuration option in configuraci√≥n section

### check collections
